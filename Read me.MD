# Data Engineering sales data Project in AWS

## Overview

This project aims to securely manage, streamline, and perform analysis on the structured and semi-structured data.

## Project Goals

- Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
- ETL System — We are getting data in raw format i'e CSV & Json, transforming this data into the proper format by flateing data from MongoDB and Jupyter note book with web hookers
- Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo S3 to store them 
- Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it
- Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS


Technologies Used:
•	Python (for ETL processing)
•	Pandas (for data transformation)
•	PyMongo (for MongoDB extraction)
•	SQLAlchemy (for Redshift integration)
•	Slack API (for real-time notifications)
•	Notebooks (Google collab, Jupyter notebook)
•	MongoDB Compass (Data Flattening)

## Dataset Used

Raw (CSV files) on daily Retail stores
