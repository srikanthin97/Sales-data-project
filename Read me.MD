 # 🛠️ Data Engineering Sales Data Project on AWS

## 🌐 Overview

This project aims to **securely manage, streamline, and analyze** both structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources, leveraging cloud infrastructure for scalability and performance.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

✅ **Data Ingestion** — Build mechanisms to ingest data from various sources (CSV, JSON, MongoDB).  
✅ **ETL System** — Transform raw data by flattening nested MongoDB data, cleaning, and standardizing it using Python and Jupyter notebooks with webhooks.  
✅ **Data Lake** — Centralize multi-source data into an S3-based data lake for easy access and storage.  
✅ **Scalability** — Design a system that can **scale seamlessly** as data volume grows.  
✅ **Cloud Integration** — Leverage **AWS** services for large-scale data processing, storage, and analytics.
